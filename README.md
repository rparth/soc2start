**Open-source GRC platform for engineers.**

Probo is a self-hostable governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) platform built for engineering and security teams. It covers the full GRC lifecycle: risk identification, control tracking, vendor risk, data privacy, access reviews, audit programs, and document approval workflows. Every entity is accessible through a web console, a CLI, a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) API, and a GraphQL API, so you can automate compliance work from code, scripts, or any LLM agent.

## Why Probo?

- **AI-native by design.** 270+ MCP tools expose every entity and operation. Any MCP-compatible LLM agent can read and write your GRC data, draft policies, run risk assessments, and generate evidence packs.
- **Full GRC coverage.** Risk management, controls, vendor risk, data privacy (DPIA/TIA), access reviews, audit programs.
- **Multiple interfaces.** Web console, `prb` CLI (44+ command groups), MCP API, GraphQL, and an n8n community node for no-code automation.
- **Open source and self-hostable.** ISC licensed. Run it on your own infrastructure with Docker.
- **Audit-ready.** Policy-based RBAC, immutable audit logs, electronic document sign-off workflows, and evidence chains.

## Capabilities

| Domain | Features |
|--------|----------|
| **Risk Management** | Risk register, inherent/residual scoring, treatment strategies (mitigate, accept, avoid, transfer), threat-based risk assessments |
| **Controls & Frameworks** | Control library with maturity levels, custom framework import/export, Statement of Applicability (SoA) |
| **Vendor / Third-Party Risk** | Vendor inventory, automated website risk assessment, DPA/BAA tracking, subprocessor discovery |
| **Data Privacy** | DPIA, Transfer Impact Assessments, processing activity records, data inventory, rights requests (SAR/erasure) |
| **Access Reviews** | Campaign management, per-entry access decisions, integration with SaaS, cloud infra, and source code sources |
| **Audit Programs** | Audit scoping, control mapping, finding tracking, report generation |
| **Evidence & Measures** | Evidence collection (files and URLs), implementation state tracking, task assignment |
| **Document Management** | Versioned documents, approval quorums, electronic signatures, PDF export, bulk operations |
| **Compliance Page** | Public compliance portal, NDA management, certification publishing, custom domain support |
| **Cookie & Consent** | Cookie banner management, tracker detection, consent records |

## Interfaces

### Web console

The primary interface for day-to-day GRC work. Runs at `http://localhost:8080` in development.

### CLI (`prb`)

A fully-featured command-line client for scripting, automation, and CI/CD integration. Covers all 44+ resource types available in the web console.

```sh
# Authenticate
prb auth login

# List open risks
prb risk list

# Create a measure and link evidence
prb measure create --name "MFA enforced on all production systems"
prb evidence create --measure <id> --file screenshot.png

# Manage vendor compliance
prb thirdpartymgmt vendor list
prb thirdpartymgmt risk-assessment create --vendor <id>
```

Run `prb help` for the full command reference.

### MCP API

Probo exposes 270+ [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools covering every entity and operation in the platform. Any MCP-compatible LLM agent (Claude, Cursor, Continue, and others) can connect directly and interact with your compliance data.

The full MCP specification is at [`pkg/server/api/mcp/v1/specification.yaml`](pkg/server/api/mcp/v1/specification.yaml).

### n8n node

The [`@probo/n8n-nodes-probo`](packages/n8n-node/) community node brings Probo into n8n workflows for no-code automation of compliance tasks over the GraphQL API.
